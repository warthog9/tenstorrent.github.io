## Operating System Requirements

The TT-QuietBox system ships without an operating system installed. We recommend installing Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish) to properly use the Tenstorrent Tensix Processors.

## QSFP-DD Connections and System Topology

### Blackhole™ p150c Version (TW-04002)

The Tenstorrent TT-QuietBox Blackhole (TW-04002) includes four Blackhole™ p150c Tensix Processors and external QSFP-DD cables that enable the Tensix Processor mesh.

This specification is still being finalized and will be added at a later date.

### Wormhole™ n300 Version (TW-04001)

The Tenstorrent TT-QuietBox Wormhole (TW-04001) includes four Wormhole™ n300 Tensix Processors and internal Warp 100 bridges and external QSFP-DD cables that enable the Tensix Processor mesh.

![](../../aibs/wormhole/images/wh_portspec.png)

The TT-QuietBox ships with the Warp 100 bridges connected, but the two QSFP-DD cables will need to be connected by the customer. This diagram displays the system topology and how the cards are enumerated, along with where the Warp 100 bridges are connected and where the included QSFP-DD cables need to be connected. 

![](qb_topology.png)

One QSFP-DD cable will need to be connected to **Port 1** on the cards in **Slots 1 and 4**.

One QSFP-DD cable will need to be connected to **Port 2** on the cards in **Slots 3 and 2**.

## Environment Specifications

The TT-QuietBox Liquid-Cooled Desktop Workstation is designed to operate at up to 35°C/95°F external ambient temperatures.

## Lighting Control

The TT-QuietBox uses a Bitspower RF Remote Controller Hub to control the lighting and the remote is included with the system. For details on how to operate it, please review the Bitspower documentation [here](BPTA-RFCHUB_IG_V3.pdf).

## Software Setup

Instructions on how to set up software on TT-QuietBox are available [here](https://docs.tenstorrent.com/getting-started/README.html).
