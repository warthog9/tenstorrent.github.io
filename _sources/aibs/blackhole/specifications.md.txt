# Specifications/Requirements

## Blackhole™ Tensix Processor

The Blackhole™ p100a, p150a, and p150b Tensix Processor add-in boards are built using the Tenstorrent Blackhole™ Tensix Processor:

- **Tensix Core Count:** 140
- **SiFive x280 "Big RISC-V" Cores:** 16
- **SRAM:** 210 MB (1.5 MB per Tensix Core)
- **Memory:** 32 GB GDDR6, 256-bit memory bus

## Card Comparison Table

**NOTE:** The **p100a** and **p150a** add-in cards are designed for desktop workstations where active cooling is required. For rack-mounted servers with sufficient forced air cooling, use the **p150b** add-in card.

## Connectivity (p150a/p150b)

Blackhole™ cards feature four ports for connecting to other cards. *(p150b pictured; p150a will have the same ports.)*
