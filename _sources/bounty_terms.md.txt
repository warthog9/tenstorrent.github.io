## About the Program

Tenstorrent offers this Program as an initiative for our community members that are helping us improve our open-source software. The Program is not a competition.

This Program is a discretionary initiative. Tenstorrent, in our sole discretion, may modify these Terms at any time and may modify, restrict, suspend, terminate, or otherwise change any aspect of this Program, including the fulfillment of any Bounty Payouts at any time. If Tenstorrent changes these Terms, by continuing to participate in the Program, you are deemed to have accepted the changes.
